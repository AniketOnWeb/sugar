Raspberry Pi are a series of small, low cost, low power computers.

Sugar can be run on a Raspberry Pi. You will need a display, keyboard and mouse.

As of August 2017, the best to use is Sugar on a Stick, as it has many activities and has regular security updates. See [Sugar on a Stick/Raspberry Pi](Sugar_on_a_Stick/Raspberry_Pi "wikilink") for how to download and install it. Sugar on a Stick is a spin of Fedora.

Other methods are;

-   using [Raspbian](Raspbian "wikilink"), the most common operating system on a Raspberry Pi, a derivative of Debian,
-   using [Fedora](Fedora "wikilink"),
-   using [Debian](Debian "wikilink"), or see [Debian/Raspberry Pi](Debian/Raspberry_Pi "wikilink") for how to install a prototype image with one or two activities,
-   using [Ubuntu](Ubuntu "wikilink"), or see [Ubuntu on rpi3](Ubuntu_on_rpi3 "wikilink") for a test report on how to install the MATE desktop and Sugar.

Developers may focus on [Fedora](Fedora "wikilink") or [Debian](Debian "wikilink") when setting up a development environment for Sugar on Raspberry Pi, because Sugar development on generic computers is focused on those operating systems.
